# Intune-Defender-Sentinel Lab

## 🔐 Modern Endpoint Management + Cloud Security Lab  
**Built by a transitioning Endpoint Administrator focused on cloud security career growth.**


## 👋 About Me

I'm an IT Support Analyst transitioning into Endpoint Administration and Cloud Security. I was first introduced to Microsoft Intune in a previous role where I supported basic device management tasks. That initial exposure got my attention — and in my current role, I had the chance to assist more directly on a VMware-to-Intune migration project.

That experience pushed me to build this lab. I wanted to go beyond what I could touch at work — so I recreated what I saw in real-world environments and explored more advanced tools like Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Sentinel.

This lab is both my hands-on training ground and a reflection of the kind of work I want to keep doing: securing endpoints, deploying with Intune, and moving deeper into cloud security roles.

> ✨ I believe God provides all that I need — and that includes this journey. I’m walking in faith and building in truth.


## 🧪 Lab Goals

✅ Build a working MDM/MAM lab with Intune  
✅ Deploy Win32 apps, enforce compliance (BitLocker, Defender AV)

✅ Test Autopilot with Hyper-V deployment  
✅ Onboard devices into Microsoft Defender for Endpoint  
✅ Connect Sentinel to Defender and create alert rules  
✅ Document each lab for real-world visibility and career readiness

## 🙏 Final Note

Thank you for reviewing this lab. This repo represents the pivot I made from classroom learning to real-world execution. School is on pause — but growth isn’t.

I plan to continue adding **Defender**, **Sentinel**, and **SC-200-level** labs daily. Follow along or connect if you're on the same path.
