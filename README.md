# Intune-Defender-Sentinel Lab  
🔐 Modern Endpoint Management + Cloud Security Lab  

Built by a transitioning Endpoint Administrator focused on cloud security career growth.

---

## 👋 About Me  
I'm an IT Support Analyst transitioning into Endpoint Administration and Cloud Security. I first encountered Microsoft Intune in a previous role supporting basic device management tasks — which sparked my interest. Recently, I helped on a VMware-to-Intune migration project that deepened my hands-on experience.

This lab is my sandbox to go beyond what I do at work — replicating real-world environments and exploring advanced tools like Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Sentinel.

This is both training and portfolio — showing the kind of work I’m passionate about: securing endpoints, deploying apps with Intune, and advancing into cloud security.

✨ I believe God provides all that I need for this journey. I’m walking in faith and building in truth.

## 🙏 Final Note

Thank you for reviewing this lab. This repo represents the pivot I made from classroom learning to real-world execution. School is on pause — but growth isn’t.

I plan to continue adding **Defender**, **Sentinel**, and **SC-200-level** labs daily. Follow along or connect if you're on the same path.
